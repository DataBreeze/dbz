# DataBreeze

A prebuilt database application framework designed using React, Redux, React-Router. 
This framework provides a configurable approach to database sources. Once configured Databreeze provides HTML menus and views such as listing multiple records as well as viewing of individual records. The system offers list, search, pagination, detail, edit, deletion, and creating of new records.  

_Databreeze is built on the CrocoDillan universal boilerplate. (https://github.com/CrocoDillon/universal-react-redux-boilerplate/tree/v2).

## What is a prebuilt framework?

The idea is to provide a complete and functional framework to quickly build web applications. Databreeze is designed so you can customize your views of data and utilize the framework to fetch and load data and state.
